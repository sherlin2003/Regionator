The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive image segmentation algorithm, which effectively divides input images into discernible regions such as headers and content, leveraging visual characteristics. Subsequently, the segmented image data will undergo conversion into text format, facilitating the system's responsiveness to user queries by furnishing specific answers corresponding to the segmented regions. This multifaceted project encompasses various stages, encompassing image preprocessing, segmentation algorithm design, text generation, and the implementation of a query-based retrieval system.
Additionally, a parallel machine learning model is constructed with the capability to autonomously generate medical reports using chest X-ray images. This advancement is poised to significantly elevate both the efficiency and precision of radiologists in their diagnostic and treatment endeavors across a spectrum of medical conditions.
